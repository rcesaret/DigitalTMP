## Instructions for End-User

This file is the central dictionary for all project-specific terminology, acronyms, and domain concepts. It ensures that all project stakeholders, including developers, researchers, and AI agents, use a consistent and unambiguous vocabulary.

## Terminology

| Term | Definition | Notes / Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1NF (First Normal Form)** | A fundamental rule in database normalization stating that a table must have a primary key, and each attribute (column) must hold atomic (indivisible) values, with no repeating groups of columns. | The "column-based artifact design" of legacy databases like `TMP_DF8`, where artifact counts for different ceramic phases are stored in separate columns (e.g., `ollaPatl`, `ollaTzac`, `ollaMica`) instead of a single column for artifact type and another for phase, is a clear violation of 1NF. |
| **3NF (Third Normal Form)** | A rule in database normalization stating that a table must be in 2NF and all its attributes must be dependent only on the primary key, not on other non-key attributes (i.e., no transitive dependencies). | Storing derivable totals like `obsidianTot` in the same table as its constituent parts (`obsidianBlades`, `obsidianWaste`) can be a 3NF violation. |
| **ACID Transactions** | A set of properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) that guarantee database transactions are processed reliably. | This is a core principle of OLTP databases, which the legacy TMP databases are not, justifying a more relaxed, OLAP-focused approach. |
| **API (Application Programming Interface)** | A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. | The project plans to create a REST API in Phase 8 to provide programmatic access to the finalized PostGIS database. |
| **Apartment Compound** | A distinctive, large, multi-family residential structure characteristic of Teotihuacan's urban landscape. | The TMP identified over 2,000 apartment compounds, which are believed to have housed the majority of the city's population. |
| **Architectural Interpretation** | The process of inferring the form and function of ancient structures from surface evidence like mounds, rubble, and artifact scatters. | René Millon was primarily responsible for the architectural interpretations published on the transparent red-ink overlays of the TMP map series. |
| **ASU** | Arizona State University. | The institutional home of the Teotihuacan Research Laboratory and the steward of the TMP data and collections. |
| **Attribute Data** | Descriptive, non-spatial information about a feature, such as artifact counts, architectural types, or chronological phases. | In this project, attribute data is primarily stored in the legacy DF and REANS databases, which are the focus of the ETL work in Phase 2. |
| **Barrio** | A Spanish term for a neighborhood or district within a city. | Used in Teotihuacan studies to refer to spatially distinct social or functional zones, such as the Merchants' Barrio or the Oaxaca Barrio. |
| **Benchmark Database** | In this project, one of two wide-format databases created from `TMP_DF9` to quantitatively test the performance of a denormalized schema against the original normalized versions. | The two benchmarks created in Phase 1 are `tmp_benchmark_wide_numeric` and `tmp_benchmark_wide_text_nulls`. |
| **Candeleros** | Small, typically two-holed ceramic objects from Teotihuacan, widely interpreted as personal incense burners. | These are one of the specific artifact types counted in the TMP databases and a key diagnostic for certain periods. |
| **Cardinality** | In database terms, the number of unique values in a column. High cardinality means many unique values; low cardinality means few. | A column for "Material Type" would have low cardinality, while a "SSN" (Site Survey Number) column would have high cardinality. |
| **Ceramic Phase** | A chronological period defined by a characteristic suite of pottery styles, forms, and wares. | Key Teotihuacan phases include Patlachique, Tzacualli, Miccaotli, Tlamimilolpa, Xolalpan, and Metepec. |
| **Choropleth Map** | A thematic map in which areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to a statistical variable, such as population density or artifact counts. | Used in Robertson (2015) to visualize spatial variation at the level of individual collection tracts. |
| **Collection Tract** | The minimum unit of spatial provenience defined during the TMP survey, for which surface observations and a systematic set of artifact collections were made. These tracts often correspond to ancient structures or compounds. | Also referred to as a "site" in TMP terminology, which can be a source of confusion. The survey identified approximately 5,500 original collection tracts, which were later consolidated into 5,046 analytical "cases" or "sites" in the DF8 database through a "merging" process. |
| **Conda** | An open-source package and environment management system used to create isolated, reproducible software environments. | The project uses a Conda environment defined in `envs/digital_tmp_base_env.yml` to ensure all developers use the same library versions. |
| **Controlled Vocabulary** | A standardized and organized set of terms used to index or catalog content, ensuring consistency. | The project develops controlled vocabularies for all categorical variables (e.g., architectural types, ceramic wares) for tDAR archival, as specified in the Phase 6 plan. |
| **Correspondence Analysis (CA)** | A multivariate statistical technique used to visualize the relationships among categorical variables in a contingency table. | Used in Robertson (2015) to analyze the association between San Martín Orange pottery types and different architectural features. |
| **CRS (Coordinate Reference System)** | A framework used to define how geographic coordinates relate to real-world locations on the Earth's surface. | Examples include the geographic system WGS84 (EPSG:4326) and the projected system UTM Zone 14N (EPSG:32614). A key challenge is transforming data from the non-standard "Millon Space" into these formal CRSs. |
| **CSV (Comma-Separated Values)** | A simple text file format used to store tabular data, where values in each row are separated by commas. | A common, non-proprietary export format for datasets intended for use in spreadsheets or statistical software, and a required format for tDAR archival. |
| **Datum** | A reference system of points, lines, and surfaces used to define the position, orientation, and scale of a coordinate system. | Key datums in this project are NAD27 (likely historical datum for the original maps) and ITRF2008/WGS84 (modern target datum). |
| **dbt (Data Build Tool)** | A command-line tool that enables data analysts and engineers to transform data in their warehouse more effectively. | Mentioned as an optional tool for implementing automated data quality validation as part of the ETL pipeline in Phase 2. |
| **Denormalization** | The strategic process of introducing redundancy into a database by merging tables to improve read performance, common in analytical (OLAP) systems. | The Phase 1 White Paper argues for denormalizing the highly normalized `TMP_DF9` into a wide-format table for better analytical usability, a decision justified by performance benchmarks. |
| **DF8, DF9, DF10** | Data File 8, 9, and 10. These are successive versions of the main TMP electronic attribute database, evolving from a flat file (DF8) to relational MS Access databases (DF9, DF10). | DF8 was the foundational VAX mainframe file; DF9 was a major relational restructuring by Ian Robertson; DF10 is the most recent version by Anne Sherfield, redesigned for usability. |
| **Docker** | A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside lightweight, portable containers. | Used in Phase 7 to package the final PostGIS database, ensuring a reproducible deployment environment for users. |
| **Ellipsoid** | A mathematical figure that approximates the shape of the Earth, used as a reference surface in geodesy. | The Clarke 1866 ellipsoid is associated with the NAD27 datum, while the GRS80/WGS84 ellipsoid is used for modern CRSs like the project's target UTM system. |
| **ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)** | A visual diagram that illustrates the structure of a database, showing tables (entities), their attributes, and the relationships between them. | Phase 1 of the project automates the generation of ERDs for all legacy databases to analyze their complexity and inform the design of the new schema. |
| **EPSG Code** | A unique identifier for a specific Coordinate Reference System, managed by the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP). | For example, EPSG:4326 represents the WGS84 geographic coordinate system, and EPSG:32614 represents the project's target projected system, UTM Zone 14N. |
| **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** | A data integration process where data is extracted from source systems, transformed into a proper format, and loaded into a target database or data warehouse. | Phase 2 of the project is a comprehensive, staged ETL pipeline to migrate legacy data from DF8, DF9, DF10, and REANS into the final unified `TMP_DF12` and `TMP_REANs_DF4` schemas. |
| **FastAPI** | A modern, high-performance Python web framework for building APIs. | Used in Phase 8 to create RESTful API endpoints for programmatic access to the project's data. |
| **Feature Engineering** | The process of creating new, informative variables (features) from existing data to improve the performance of analytical models or provide deeper insights. | Phase 5 involves geospatial feature engineering, such as calculating structure density, proximity to features like the Avenue of the Dead, and shape complexity metrics. |
| **GCP (Ground Control Point)** | A point on the Earth's surface with known real-world coordinates, used to georeference maps or imagery. | The project uses a set of over 1,900 GCPs to develop a transformation model to convert data from "Millon Space" to a standard CRS. |
| **GDAL/OGR** | Geospatial Data Abstraction Library / OpenGIS Simple Features Reference Implementation. A core open-source library for reading, writing, and manipulating raster and vector geospatial data formats. | Used extensively throughout the project for tasks like format conversion, reprojection (via `gdal.Warp`), and raster processing. |
| **Geodatabase** | A container for storing and managing various types of GIS data (vector, raster, tables) within a single file system folder or relational database. | The final PostGIS database serves as a powerful, multi-user spatial geodatabase for the integrated TMP data. |
| **GeoJSON** | An open standard format for encoding collections of simple geographical features along with their non-spatial attributes, based on JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). | A primary format for data served by the Phase 8 API and for use in the Leaflet.js web map. Also an accepted archival format for tDAR. |
| **GeoPandas** | A Python library that extends the data types used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types. | A key tool for vector data manipulation, analysis, and transformation in the project's Python workflows. |
| **Georeferencing** | The process of assigning real-world coordinates to spatial data, such as a scanned map or aerial photograph, so it can be correctly positioned in a GIS. | A central challenge of the project (Phase 4) is to accurately georeference all TMP data from the local "Millon Space" to UTM Zone 14N. |
| **GeoTIFF** | A public domain metadata standard that allows georeferencing information to be embedded within a TIFF raster image file. | The project uses GeoTIFFs for storing scanned maps and derived raster products like the NTv2 shift grid. |
| **Great Expectations** | A Python library for data validation, documentation, and profiling, used to maintain data quality through automated testing. | A key tool for the project's automated data quality framework, planned for implementation in the Phase 2 ETL pipeline. |
| **INAH** | Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia. Mexico's federal government bureau responsible for the nation's archaeological and historical heritage. | An essential institutional partner and stakeholder for any research conducted at Teotihuacan. |
| **INEGI** | Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía. Mexico's national agency for statistics and geography, responsible for official cartographic data. | INEGI's modern datasets and CRS standards are a key reference for the project's georeferencing work. |
| **Insubstantial Structure** | A TMP architectural classification for sites with surface artifact scatters suggesting the presence of small, simple buildings made of perishable materials, likely housing lower-status residents. | Over 800 such sites were identified by the TMP, often symbolized by a small red square on the interpretation maps. |
| **ITRF2008** | International Terrestrial Reference Frame 2008. A highly accurate, global geodetic datum that is the basis for modern CRSs in Mexico. | The project's target modern datum for georeferencing. |
| **JDI (Join-Dependency Index)** | A custom, heuristic metric developed in Phase 1 to quantify the relational complexity of a database schema, based on the number of foreign keys relative to the number of tables. | A high JDI suggests a highly normalized schema (like DF9) that will require many joins for analysis. |
| **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** | A lightweight, text-based data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. | Used for configuration files (`metadata.json`) and API responses (GeoJSON). |
| **Jupyter Notebook** | An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. | Used extensively in Phase 1 for data analysis and reporting, and will be used for creating tutorials in Phase 8. |
| **Lanczos Resampling** | An advanced interpolation method used for resizing or reprojecting raster images, known for producing sharp, high-quality results but being computationally intensive. | A potential resampling method (`resampleAlg='lanczos'`) for `gdal.Warp` when georeferencing the TMP raster maps to preserve detail. |
| **Leaflet.js** | An open-source JavaScript library for creating mobile-friendly, interactive maps. | Used in Phase 8 to build the project's public-facing WebGIS dashboard. |
| **LIF (Lookup Inflation Factor)** | A custom, heuristic metric developed in Phase 1 to quantify the proportion of data columns that are coded values requiring a join to a separate lookup table to be human-readable. | A high LIF indicates a heavy reliance on lookup tables, increasing query complexity for analysis, a key feature of the DF9 schema. |
| **LISA (Local Indicators of Spatial Association)** | A set of statistical methods used to identify spatial clusters and outliers by measuring the association between a feature's value and the values of its neighbors. | Used in Robertson (2015) to analyze the spatial distribution of San Martín Orange pottery. |
| **Long-Format Table** | A "tidy" data structure where each row is a single observation and each column is a variable. This contrasts with a wide-format table where observations for a single subject are spread across multiple columns. | The `TMP_DF10` database was restructured into a long format to reduce the number of zero values and improve analytical usability in modern software. |
| **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** | A standardized protocol enabling AI agents to interact with various tools and services (like file systems, search engines, or code repositories) through natural language-driven APIs. | The `current_mcps_info.md` document details the 12 MCP servers and tools used in this project's Windsurf IDE development environment. |
| **Merging** | In the context of the TMP databases, the process of combining records from multiple original field collections into a single analytical unit or "case," typically representing a single ancient structure. This was a key feature in the creation of the DF8 database. | This "not always clearly documented" process became a "major problem" for later data integration, creating a fundamental incompatibility between the merged, structure-based units of DF8/DF9 and the individual, collection-based units of the REANS database, a challenge that persisted for decades. |
| **Metadata** | Data that provides descriptive information about other data, such as its origin, structure, content, and context. | A core goal of the project (Phase 6) is to create comprehensive, standardized metadata for all datasets to ensure their long-term usability and successful archival in tDAR. |
| **MF2 / MF3** | Map File 2 / Map File 3. Digital GIS files (shapefiles) of the TMP collection tract boundaries, originally created by Ian Robertson. | MF3 is a "topologically clean" version of MF2, with geometric errors like overlapping polygons corrected to ensure data integrity for advanced spatial analysis. |
| **Millon Space** | The colloquial term for the custom, non-standard, local Cartesian coordinate system used for the original TMP maps and early GIS files. It is oriented ~15°25' east of true north but is not aligned with any known CRS. | A central task of the project (Phase 4) is to develop a robust transformation from Millon Space to standard CRSs like UTM using a custom NTv2 grid. |
| **Moran's I** | A statistic used to measure spatial autocorrelation, indicating whether the pattern of feature values is clustered, dispersed, or random. | Used in the project to assess the spatial distribution of georeferencing errors (GCP residuals) to check for systematic bias in the transformation model. |
| **NAD27 (North American Datum of 1927)** | A historical geodetic datum that was the standard for mapping in North America for much of the 20th century. | Identified as the likely historical datum for the original TMP maps, which were produced before the widespread adoption of WGS84. |
| **Normalization** | The process of organizing the columns and tables of a relational database to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity, typically by splitting large tables into smaller, well-structured ones. | The legacy TMP databases, particularly `TMP_DF9`, are highly normalized, which the project argues is ill-suited for analytical use and justifies a denormalization strategy. |
| **NSF** | National Science Foundation. A U.S. government agency that supports fundamental research and education in science and engineering. | The NSF funded the original TMP and the subsequent data curation and enhancement grants at ASU that produced much of the legacy data being integrated. |
| **NTv2 (National Transformation version 2)** | A standard format for grid shift files that store the displacement values needed to transform coordinates between different geodetic datums. | The project generates a custom NTv2 grid file (`.gsb`) to handle the complex, non-linear distortions when transforming from Millon Space to UTM. |
| **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)** | A category of software tools and database systems designed for fast, complex queries and analysis of large amounts of historical data, prioritizing read performance. | The project argues the final TMP database should be designed as an OLAP system, hence the denormalization strategy. |
| **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)** | A category of software tools and database systems designed to handle a large number of short, frequent transactions, prioritizing write performance and data integrity. | The highly normalized structure of DF9 is more suited to an OLTP system, which is a mismatch for its actual analytical use case. |
| **Olla** | A common type of spherical, wide-mouthed ceramic pot used for cooking or storage in Mesoamerica. | A key artifact category counted in the TMP databases, with specific counts for different chronological phases (e.g., `ollaPatl`, `ollaTzac`). |
| **Pandas** | A powerful and widely used open-source Python library for data manipulation and analysis, providing data structures like the DataFrame. | A core tool used in the project's data transformation and analysis scripts. |
| **PCSF (Pedro & Ceferino Subversion Factor)** | A term coined by Mary Hopkins to describe instances where the experienced TMP technicians Pedro Baños and Zeferino Ortega used their own expert judgment during the ceramic reanalysis, even if it contradicted the official criteria from supervisors. | This is a documented source of unstandardized but often more accurate data within the REANS database. |
| **Photogrammetry** | The science and technology of obtaining reliable information about physical objects and the environment through the process of recording, measuring, and interpreting photographic images. | The original TMP base map was created using low-altitude aerial photogrammetry conducted in 1962. |
| **PostGIS** | A spatial database extender for the PostgreSQL object-relational database. It adds support for geographic objects, allowing location queries to be run in SQL. | The target platform for the project's final, integrated geospatial database in Phase 7. |
| **PostgreSQL** | A powerful, open-source object-relational database system known for its reliability, feature robustness, and performance. | The chosen database system for the entire project, replacing the legacy MS Access files. |
| **Primary Key (PK)** | A field (or set of fields) in a database table that uniquely identifies each record in that table. | The `SSN` (Site Survey Number) serves as the primary key for the main TMP data tables, linking attribute and spatial data. |
| **PROJ** | A generic coordinate transformation software library that transforms geospatial coordinates from one coordinate reference system (CRS) to another. | A fundamental, underlying library used by GDAL and QGIS for all georeferencing and reprojection tasks in the project. |
| **Provenance** | The documented history and origin of a piece of data, from its source through any transformations it has undergone. | A core guiding principle of the project is to maintain complete data provenance for all datasets, from original SSR forms to the final integrated database. |
| **Python** | A high-level, general-purpose programming language widely used in data science, web development, and automation. | The primary programming language used for all scripting, data processing, and analysis in this project. |
| **QGIS** | A free and open-source cross-platform desktop Geographic Information System (GIS) application that supports viewing, editing, and analysis of geospatial data. | The primary desktop GIS software used for manual digitization (Phase 3), georeferencing, and quality assurance. |
| **Raster Data** | A type of geospatial data that represents features as a grid of cells or pixels, with each cell having a value. | Examples in this project include the scanned historical TMP maps and the derived NTv2 shift grid GeoTIFF. |
| **REANS (Ceramic Reanalysis)** | A comprehensive reanalysis of the TMP ceramic collections undertaken from roughly 1973 to 1983 under the direction of George Cowgill and Evelyn Rattray. It was designed to capture more detailed typological and chronological information than was available in DF8. | The resulting REANS database is a key dataset being integrated in this project. Its terminology and classifications are closely aligned with Rattray's (2001) major publication on Teotihuacan ceramics. |
| **Relational Database** | A database structured to recognize relations among stored items of information, typically organized as a set of tables with rows and columns. | DF9 and DF10 are relational databases, contrasting with the earlier flat-file structure of DF8. |
| **Resampling** | In GIS, the process of determining the new values for cells in a raster grid when it is being transformed to a new coordinate system or resolution. | Common methods include Nearest Neighbor, Bilinear, and Cubic Convolution. Lanczos is a high-quality but computationally intensive option considered for this project. |
| **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)** | A standard statistical measure of the differences between values predicted by a model and the values observed. In georeferencing, it quantifies the overall accuracy of the transformation. | Used in Phase 4 to assess the accuracy of the georeferencing transformations, with a target of <2m. |
| **Rubber-sheeting** | A non-linear transformation method used in GIS to correct localized, non-systematic distortions in a map or image by "stretching" it to fit a set of control points. | Thin Plate Spline (TPS) is a form of rubber-sheeting used in this project to generate the NTv2 grid. |
| **San Martín Orange (SMO)** | An important and common domestic ceramic ware at Teotihuacan, particularly during the Xolalpan and Metepec phases. | Its distribution is a key subject of analysis in Robertson (2015). |
| **Schema** | The structure of a database, describing the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed (e.g., table names, column names, data types, relationships). | A major goal of Phase 1 is to analyze the schemas of the legacy databases to design an optimal new one for the final PostGIS database. |
| **Shapefile** | A popular geospatial vector data format for GIS software, developed by Esri. It stores the location, shape, and attributes of geographic features. | A primary format for vector data in this project, especially for archival in tDAR. |
| **Site** | In TMP terminology, this refers to the minimum unit of spatial provenience defined during the survey, often corresponding to a single collection tract or an ancient structure. | This specific usage can be confusing, as "site" in archaeology usually refers to an entire settlement like Teotihuacan itself. This term is often used interchangeably with "collection tract" or "case". |
| **"Specials"** | A term used in the TMP project to refer to artifacts (especially diagnostic or rare sherds) that were physically removed from their original collection bags for separate curation, study, or inclusion in type collections. | The "sometimes undocumented or ambiguously documented" removal of "specials" is a major source of data quality issues and count discrepancies in the REANS database. |
| **SQL (Structured Query Language)** | A standard programming language used for managing and manipulating data in relational databases. | Used extensively for creating benchmark databases in Phase 1 and will be the primary way to query the final PostGIS database. |
| **SQLAlchemy** | A Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL. | Used in the project's Python scripts for interacting with the PostgreSQL databases, particularly in the profiling modules of Phase 1. |
| **SSN (Site Survey Number)** | A unique numeric identifier (from 1 to 5050) assigned to each collection tract or "case" in the TMP electronic databases, serving as a primary key. | This ID is crucial for linking all attribute (DF10) and spatial (MF3) data together. |
| **SSR (Site Survey Record)** | The standardized paper form used during the TMP fieldwork to record observations, artifact counts, and interpretations for each collection tract. | The primary analog source for much of the data in the electronic databases. A key challenge is that not all nuanced qualitative data from the SSRs was digitized. |
| **Talud-tablero** | A distinctive architectural style common in Mesoamerica, characterized by an inward-sloping surface or panel (the *talud*) surmounted by a rectangular panel perpendicular to the ground (the *tablero*). | A hallmark of Teotihuacan's monumental architecture, and a feature to be digitized in Phase 3. |
| **tDAR (The Digital Archaeological Record)** | An international, CoreTrustSeal Certified digital repository for the digital records of archaeological investigations, governed by Digital Antiquity at ASU. | The designated long-term archival repository for all outputs of this project, as specified in Phase 6 of the project plan. |
| **Thin Orange Ware** | A distinctive, high-quality, and widely traded ceramic ware, likely produced outside the Basin of Mexico but found in significant quantities at Teotihuacan. | A key ceramic type tracked in the TMP databases. |
| **Three-Temple Group (3TG)** | A specific architectural pattern found at Teotihuacan and other Mesoamerican sites, consisting of three temple structures arranged around a common plaza. | A key architectural classification used in the project's GIS and database. |
| **Thin Plate Spline (TPS)** | A non-parametric, "rubber-sheeting" transformation method that is highly effective at correcting localized, non-systematic distortions in spatial data. | The chosen method for generating the NTv2 grid to georeference the TMP data from Millon Space in Phase 4. |
| **TMP (Teotihuacan Mapping Project)** | The landmark archaeological survey and mapping project of the ancient city of Teotihuacan, directed by René Millon in the 1960s, which produced the foundational datasets for this project. | The central subject of all the provided documentation. |
| **Topology** | In GIS, the set of rules and spatial relationships that define how points, lines, and polygons share geometry (e.g., adjacency, connectivity, containment). | "Topological cleaning" involves correcting errors like overlapping polygons or gaps to ensure data integrity, a key task for preparing the MF3 shapefile. |
| **Transformation** | In GIS, the process of converting coordinates from one coordinate reference system (CRS) to another. | A core activity of the project is defining and applying a transformation from "Millon Space" to standard CRSs. |
| **UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator)** | A global system of map projections that divides the Earth into 60 zones, each with its own projected coordinate system, providing accurate measurements in meters. | UTM Zone 14N (EPSG:32614) is the primary target projected CRS for the georeferenced TMP data. |
| **Vector Data** | A type of geospatial data that represents geographic features as points, lines, or polygons with associated attribute information. | The collection tract boundaries and architectural features are stored as vector data. |
| **Voronoi Tessellation** | A partitioning of a plane into regions based on distance to a specified set of points. Each region consists of all points closer to one particular seed point than to any other. | Mentioned in Robertson (2015) as a method for spatial analysis. |
| **WGS84 (World Geodetic System 1984)** | A global datum and geographic coordinate reference system used by the Global Positioning System (GPS). It is the de facto standard for many web mapping applications. | The geographic CRS (EPSG:4326) used for web distribution and the underlying datum for the target UTM projection. |
| **Wide-Format Table** | A data structure where each subject has a single row, and observations for that subject are in separate columns. This is often denormalized and can be sparse. | The project's benchmark databases are created in a wide format to test analytical performance against more normalized schemas. |
| **YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)** | A human-readable data serialization standard often used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted. | Used in the project for storing the Conda environment definition (`digital_tmp_base_env.yml`). |
